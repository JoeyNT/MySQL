<h1 align="center">U-Mobile </h1>
<h3 align="center">Telecommunications (Phone Service Provider)</h3>

- Currently with phone services customers arenâ€™t able to add a line without rigorous in-person identification verification. U-mobile allows for online identification verification of existing plans. Now existing members can now add members to their plan online if they have an e-SIM. 
- We chose this organization to allow ease for customers to add lines to existing phone plans without having to undergo long wait times and a service break
